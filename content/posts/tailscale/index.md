I've been fiddling with Tailscale for a while. It has always seemed like a really interesting piece of tech but there have been a few things that have held me back from going all in.

For context, Tailscale is a VPN platform built on top of Wireguard that builds a flat, programmable network. It has some helpful features to help keep clients connected in ways that Wireguard wont, by default. This helps with clients that are behind complex NATs.

I've been running my own Wireguard tunnels for home access since before Tailscale came out and was always pretty impressed with what Wireguard represents over the alternatives. I ran an OpenVPN tunnel a long time ago and, to be honest, it was comparatively crap. Wireguard being just a key pair is so simple and the performance is basically native.

This meant that my remote access solution was heavily centered on my Pfsense router for both Wireguard tunnel hosting and all of the routing rules.
