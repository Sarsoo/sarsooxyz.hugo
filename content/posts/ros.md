One of my 3rd-year university modules was a robotics module working with the ROS ecosystem in Python and C++. The course worked through the theory of the field including navigation and mapping in the context of how this is implemented in ROS.

It was one of my favourite modules, a lot felt like it was implementing theory from the Computer Vision module I had just finished and that was some of the best stuff I had done so far at uni. This included material from both sides of the field, computer vision and machine learning, with application of algorithms such as the Kalman filter.
