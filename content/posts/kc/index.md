I've worked in C++ before but it's always been with MSVC in a Windows environment. This is all well and good but I haven't had a project that I bootstrapped myself and I haven't had any experience with CMake or C++ 3rd party libraries.

In order to rectify this I needed a context, and one that seemed relevant was my Obsidian notes system.

# obsidian

I'm a big fan of Obsidian, it's so easy to use with incredible flexibility and a really high configurability ceiling. It's only downside is that it isn't open source but the notes content is and you really aren't tied to Obsidian apart from it's plugin ecosystem. I love that, because my Obsidian vault is also a git repo, my notes render perfectly in Gitea/GitHub.

# cmake

# ntfy
